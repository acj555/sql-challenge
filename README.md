# sql-challenge

This repository has everything needed for my SQL HW assignment. 


It contains an image of my Entity Relationship Diagram for all tables. 

The SQL file of my table schemata can be used to create all of the tables, columns, and relationships between the tables.    

Then, the SQL file of my queries can be used to extract specific data from these tables.
